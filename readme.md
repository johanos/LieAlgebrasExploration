## Lie Algebras

There's a lot of information about Lie algebras in the literature, but it can be a little obtuse to understand why it is important.

This repo is just a quick doodle on applications of lie algebras for optimization. Basically, how to extract the lie algebra from a rotation matrix, using both the exponential map and the axis-angle. Additionally how to generate a rotation matrix from the lie algebra via the exponential map OR the Rodrigues formula.

Please look at this wonderful series of videos by [Mathemaniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlqVo3sJFLE&list=PLDcSwjT2BF_WDki-WvmJ__Q0nLIHuNPbP) the subject of Lie algebras. It is a great introduction to the subject and covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time.
